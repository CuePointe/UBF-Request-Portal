## 🌿 About This System

The **UBF Logistics & Procurement System** is a web-based internal portal developed for the Uganda Biodiversity Fund to digitise, streamline and audit all procurement and logistics workflows. It replaces manual paper-based processes with a structured, role-based digital approval chain that is accessible to all staff from any device with a browser.

All data is stored securely inside this GitHub repository. All approvals, submissions, comments and attachments are permanently recorded as Git commits — creating a tamper-proof audit trail.

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: Pure HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- Database: GitHub Contents API (JSON flat-file)
- Authentication: SHA-256 password hashing via Web Crypto API
- Hosting: GitHub Pages (free, zero infrastructure)
- Storage: GitHub repository (1 GB limit, effectively unlimited for this use case)

---

## 🔐 Security

- Passwords are hashed using **SHA-256** in the browser before any comparison — plain text passwords are never stored or transmitted
- Each password expires every **90 days** — staff are forced to set a new password on expiry
- Sessions expire after **8 hours** of inactivity
- The GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) is stored in browser `localStorage` and is never embedded in source code
- All API calls go directly to `api.github.com` over HTTPS
- Role-based filtering ensures staff can only see their own submissions

## 🛠️ System Administration

### Adding a New Staff Member

1. Open `data/users.json` in this repository
2. Add a new entry following this format:

```json
{
  "email": "newstaff@ugandabiodiversityfund.org",
  "name": "Full Name",
  "role": "Staff",
  "title": "Job Title",
  "passwordHash": "8c6976e5b5410415bde908bd4dee15dfb167a9c873fc4bb8a81f6f2ab448a918",
  "passwordExpiry": "2026-12-31",
  "mustChangePassword": true,
  "active": true
}
```

3. Also add the email and role to the `STAFF` object in `data.js`
4. The default password hash above corresponds to `admin` — the new staff member will be forced to change it on first login

### Resetting a Password

Edit `data/users.json`, set `mustChangePassword` to `true` and `passwordExpiry` to a past date. The staff member will be prompted to set a new password on next login.

### Deactivating a Staff Member

Set `"active": false` in their entry in `data/users.json`.
